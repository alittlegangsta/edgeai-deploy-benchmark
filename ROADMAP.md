# Roadmap

## Stage 1: PC deployment baseline

The PC work is organized as three auditable batches:

- Batch A, Tasks 002–005, is completed and Checkpoint A is approved. It freezes
  YOLOv5n v7.0 and provides the tested Python ONNX Runtime reference.
- Batch B, Tasks 006–009, is completed and Checkpoint B is approved. It provides
  shared C++ processing, C++ ONNX Runtime image/video inference, and the unified
  benchmark method.
- Batch C, Tasks 010–012, is completed and Checkpoint C is approved. It contains
  the fixed TorchScript/pnnx ncnn conversion, C++ ncnn image/video/benchmark path,
  order-balanced three-backend benchmark, and final PC acceptance.

`tasks/000_pc_stage_execution_protocol.md` defines selection, state transitions,
evidence, retry limits, blocking reports, recovery, commits, and human checkpoints.
PC Stage 1 is complete. The approved WSL2 measurements must not be generalized
to ARM or other systems.

## Stage 2: Anlogic DR1 ARM CPU baseline

This stage is `Not implemented / Planned`. Although Checkpoint C is approved,
Task 013 and later ARM work require separate authorization and have not started.

## Future work: explicitly out of scope

Work beyond the two stages above is outside the current roadmap.
